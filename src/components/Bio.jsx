          <p>My name is Olivia and I am a Full-Stack coder looking to enter the industry. I have taken a web development bootcamp at the University of Toronto which gave me the opportunity to learn and practice multiple coding languages and work on challenging projects with my classmates. Some of the projects created during this bootcamp are included on my portfolio page which can be found in the navigation bar at the top of the page. </p>
