## Description

This is my professional portfolio created using **React**.

This portfolio is a compilation of all of my best projects to demonstrate my knowledge and skills to future employers. I am a UofT Bootcamp student just starting out in web development, but I am hoping to become a back-end dev once I am able to refine my learning and experience.
