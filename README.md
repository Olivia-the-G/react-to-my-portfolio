## Description

This is my professional portfolio created using **React**. The website was made up using **MUI Core**. This is an open source React library used for creating responsive web applications. See [Technologies Used](#technologies-used) to learn more about these features. 

This portfolio is a compilation of all of my best projects to demonstrate my knowledge and skills to future employers. I am a UofT Bootcamp student just starting out in web development, but I am hoping to become a back-end dev once I am able to refine my learning and experience.
